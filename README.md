# Project4 - BookBlog

This project is created as part of Code Institute's Software Development course.
[BookBlog's](https://bkblog-fdb72a8c4df9.herokuapp.com/) layout and code is based on Code Institute's Walk-through project
["I Think Therefore I Blog"](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/blog/tree/main). BookBlog has no commercial intention.

Bookblog is for sharing beautiful moments and experiences, wonderful books through blog posts. 

For now only Admin can create blog posts, and users can read blog posts, comment on the blog posts, access resources, sign up and sign in, or fill in a Collaboration Form
on About page. All of the articles, reviews, comments and suggestions need to be approved by BookBlog's Admin, the Developer.
As this is a project, this website's forms are not monitored.

## ReadMe Images, links 

Developer checked ReadMe Images, and updated path where needed. And tested ReadMe links, to ensure each link opened the right page, or image, or brought Visitor back to Content or a Different part of ReadMe. Developer noticed some of the image sizes were too big for ReadMe. Due to time constraint, developer didn't get to reduce sizes of all of ReadMe images.

## Bugs

### Fixed

- Resources app displayed only one resource at a time. With tutor's guidance to add for loop, all of the resources were displayed (for original version of this project)

- Collaboration Form confirmation mentioned Collaboration Request. Developer changed 'request' for 'form' in about>views.py, to match the wording of the form and confirmation:

Before:

![Collaboration Request](docs/readmeimages/readmerequestreceived.png)

After:

![Collaboration Form](docs/readmeimages/readmeformreceived.png)

### Images post_detail.html

- Images for bookblog articles showed up as expected on the Home page, matching the subject of the Title.

![Correct images](docs/readmeimages/correctimages.png)

- When developer clicked on any post, the new page displayed the placeholder image instead of the unique image selected for each post.

![Placeholder image](docs/readmeimages/placeholderimage.png)

- Developer had inspected the page before:

[Previous image](docs/readmeimages/previousinspection.png)

- This time the developer clicked on the image part of the page instead:

[New inspection](docs/readmeimages/newinspection.png)

- The developer finally saw the right area, where image details were
- The developer then compared codes of the images between home page and the new tab:

[Correct code](docs/readmeimages/correctimagecode.png)

[Placeholder code](docs/readmeimages/placeholder.png)

- By matching post_detail.html image code with the home page one, the correct images started to display in the new tab as well:

[Correct image displayed](docs/readmeimages/correctimagedisplayed.png)

### am I Responsive

- am I responsive test showed white screens instead of the website: [Blank am I responsive](docs/readmeimages/amiresponsiveblank.png)
  Thanks to Kera's post on Slack, developer found out that she needed to install [an extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ignore-x-frame-headers/gleekbfjekiniecknbkamfmkohkpodhe?pli=1), so that Heroku site could be tested for responsiveness. Sorted! Am I responsive image displayed at the start of the ReadMe.

### Known Bugs

- Images on Home page, on Next page, too big and not same size
- Resources and About showing up in Django as Resourcess and Abouts
- On Django, Collaboration requests needs to be replaced with Collaboration Form 
- Collaboration form to be made smaller to fit on the screen better
- When blog post is open, the image of the post is not displaying fully, while it is fully displayed on Home Screen, on various screen sizes
- Resources is missing an image/video on top of the page
- Resources are displayed only as text or link, instead of an image of the page
- js validation showed one error, not fixed
- Spelling check was not done for all parts of the website
- Sign up boxes could be shown in a nicer way, at the moment they are not lined up evenly
- Alert messages, pop ups are showing up in the color of the walk-through, instead of developer's chosen color of blue
- Admin and Site Users are not able to create posts when logged in. Admin can create posts via Django
- Not all of the python files have been checked with [CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/)
- When filling Sign Up form, and existing Username is chosen, Visitor is not informed straigt away that this Username is already taken, instead, cursor moves to Password  field (as email is optional). Yet when user clicks on Sign Up button, while existing Username is on Username field, and password does not match that Username, User is notified above Username field: "A User with that username already exists".
  It would be beneficial and time saving for users if system recognised earlier that this Username was already taken, and informed User to choose a different Username.
- There are errors showing in some of the python files, checked by developer:

![Python error](docs/readmeimages/indentationpython.png)

- Error pages not added

- In Django, when Resource is marked as a Draft, it still shows up on the Website, just at the bottom of the page, separated from Published ones,
  and still clickable, usable:

![Resource Draft](docs/readmeimages/draftresource.png)

![Resource Draft Available on the Website](docs/readmeimages/resourcesdraftvisibleclickable.png)

- Developer unapproved the Resource, by unchecking checkbox beside 'Approved', and Draft/Unapproved Resource was still displayed on the page, and clickable:

![Resource Draft, Unapproved](docs/readmeimages/resourcedraftnotapproved.png)

Developer deleted The Alps 4K Resource (even though it was beautiful, and suited bookblog Resources), as it wasn't responding to draft/unapproved changes. Developer understand that issue was not with the video itself.

# References & Credits

- BookBlog's code is based on following Code Institute's Walk-through project ["I Think Therefore I Blog"](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/blog/tree/main) . 
  The developer has credited Walk-through mainly on top of html files, 
  due to enourmous number of other files, which are all coded like Walk-through project.

- General ReadMe template derived from: [findMEreadME](https://github.com/brodsa/findMEreadME/blob/main/README.md#content)

- Developer got inspiration for her ReadMe User Stories layout from her Facilitator Laura's Project 4: [The Happy Reader](https://github.com/LauraMayock/The-happy-reader/blob/main/README.md)

- Responsiveness test/image created with: [am I responsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive)

- Wireframes created with [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/)

- Developer read this article to remember how to get links to open in a new tab. Article by Jessica Wilkins: [How to Open a Link in a New Tab](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-open-a-link-in-a-new-tab/#:~:text=You%20can%20use%20the%20target,opening%20anchor%20tag%20like%20this.)
 
- How to add favicon: [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_favicon.asp)

- Thanks to tutor Oisin's guidelines, Developer learned from [this ReadMe](https://github.com/Dimitris112/rum-away-testp4/blob/main/TESTING.md)
  how to add an extra file to document testing, and how to format testing tables. Due to part of the testing going missing from Testing.md, as Developer was on powershell terminal, instead of bash (tutor Rebecca helped developer to solve powershell/bash incident), Developer moved all of the testing back to Readme.md
